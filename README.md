# Run the Project

Make sure you have `pnpm` or `npm` installed

- Run `pnpm install` to install all the dependencies
- Run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server
- The application will be up and running on `http://localhost:5173/`

## Disable Cors

The application uses the data from the api endpoint `http://2.233.121.120:1085/energy.php`. This will by default give cors error. To disable the cors error install an extension like this https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc?hl=en-US to disable cors and get data without any erros.
